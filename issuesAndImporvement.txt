Issues and Areas for Improvement

Code Structure and Organization
Type Safety Issues: Some components use any types (e.g., in WelcomeScreen's onFileClick prop) which reduces TypeScript's benefits
Inconsistent Component Definitions: Some components use React.FC while others don't
Redundant Code: There's duplication in theme handling between App.tsx and Settings.tsx
Missing Error Boundaries: No error boundaries to gracefully handle runtime errors
Lack of Code Splitting: No lazy loading for components which could improve initial load time
Inconsistent State Management: Mix of prop drilling and local state management
Hardcoded Data: Portfolio content is hardcoded rather than stored in separate data files

Performance Issues

Large Bundle Size: No code splitting or lazy loading for route-based components
Unoptimized Images: Some images may not be properly optimized for web
Unnecessary Re-renders: Missing memoization for components that don't need to re-render
